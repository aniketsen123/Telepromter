This is an Telepromter app that I have imported it was in java , and there where many issues as the gradle was outdated. when i tried to run it showed error in gradle I reimported it by changing the version in project structures then it runned . But it still showed error while building apk .Then i converted the whole thing to kotlin . And now it is working fine.
